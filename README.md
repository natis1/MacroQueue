MacroQueue. Inspired by and code taken from Redirect. But probably incompatible with it.

## How To Install

### Questions

#### Can I be banned for this?

Yeah. You use this at your own risk. It requires adding commands to macros that do not normally exist.

If your macros are saved to the cloud for whatever reason this can probably be detected.

#### Are there any incompatibilities?

I have no idea. It probably doesn't work with Redirect or BossMod since it hooks into the same function.

#### Is this cheating?

Yeah, obviously, and I dislike when "QoL" mods step around the term with dubious excuses.

I wouldn't use this in any competitive content. I have explicitly disabled it for PVP.

We all draw the line as to acceptable behavior at different points.

#### Where do you draw the line at acceptable macro/too far?

The Redirect plugin states the following for its macro queuing functionality:

> If you use a macro that has multiple actions that can succeed while you are not casting, it will use the first one immediately and queue the second one. This is the intended behavior.

Does that mean with this plugin you can play the game with one button? Probably not but maybe. My intent with this is to make a mod that is useful
for a very specific class of macros.

For example. Consider the following usecase.

1. A GCD macro, that attempts multiple mutually exclusive GCD actions.
2. A "use any mitigation" macro, that uses ONE of your oGCD mitigations picked from a list.

With the redirect plugin, the first of these macros works fine.
But the second one breaks "by design". With the base game, the second macro works fine but the first breaks.

By selectively turning on and off queueing, both of these macros can be made to work.

I cannot tell you where to draw the line at cheating vs fair play but
